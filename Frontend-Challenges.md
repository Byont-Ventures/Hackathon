# Frontend Challenges

These challenges provide a way to get started with Web3 frontend development. To help you get started, we have included a well-tested Web3 Template in the [src](./src/) folder.  

The frontend is built on [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) with [NextJS 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13#new-app-directory-beta), so we will make use of the [app directory](./src/app/) for our pages. It also includes the [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/docs/getting-started) library. Wagmi has over 20 hooks that will make connecting your frontend to the blockchain easier.

The goal is to eventually build a full-fletched NFT minting Dapp! If you don't know what this means, don't worry, it will all become clear.

## Challenge 1 - The Dapp

If you do not know what a Dapp is, we recommend you read [this section](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/).

Let's begin with an easy challenge, running the Dapp.

```yarn run fe:dev``` 

You will see a welcome message, a test message with a number below and a footer.
