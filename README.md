# Byont x RTL Talpa workshop

**This repository is under construction; the coding challenges are expected to be updated regularly**

The first day of the workshop will be about getting your hands dirty in the Web3 space by creating (your first) NFT project! This project will be initially divided into three tracks - Frontend, Backend, and Stretch challenges. This repo will contain just about everything you need to get started on developing your first Web3 Dapp. There are different tracks and general instructions on setting everything up and preparing for the workshop.

- [Workshop Preparation](Workshop-Preparation.md)
- [Web3 Template Docs](Web3-Template.md)
- [Frontend Challenges WIP]() => Build components around given web3 hooks
- [Backend Challenges WIP](Backend-Challenges.md) => Solidity, testing with Foundry
- [Stretch Challenges WIP]() => More advanced

## Coding Challenges

The workshop is a collection of coding challenges to get you warmed up with solidity development in general. It is not a complete solidity tutorial, as that is too much to learn in one day, but it is an excellent primer to grasp the overall concept. The end goal of this workshop is to enable you to build your own NFT! Remember that sometimes there are multiple ways to get to a solution. We encourage you to look things up online or ask questions if you are lost. We will be sharing helpful resources with you throughout this course.
