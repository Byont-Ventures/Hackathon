# Web3 Workshop

**This repository is under construction; the coding challenges are expected to be updated regularly**

The first day of the workshop will be about getting your hands dirty in the Web3 space by creating (your first) NFT project! This project will be initially divided into three tracks - Frontend, Backend, and Stretch challenges. This repo will contain just about everything you need to get started on developing your first Web3 Dapp. There are different tracks and general instructions on setting everything up and preparing for the workshop.

You may choose to start with the stretch challenges straight away if you are working in teams. In this case, we recommend giving the challenges of your respective track a try before the workshop.

- [Workshop Preparation](Workshop-Preparation.md)
- [Web3 Template Docs](Web3-Template.md)
- [Frontend Challenges WIP](Frontend-Challenges.md) => Build components around given web3 hooks
- [Backend Challenges WIP](Backend-Challenges.md) => Solidity, testing with Foundry
- [Stretch Challenges WIP]() => More advanced

## Coding Challenges

The workshop is a collection of coding challenges to get you warmed up with Web3 development in general. It is not a complete tutorial, as that is too much to learn in one day, but it is an excellent primer to grasp the overall concept. The end goal of this workshop is to enable you to build your own NFT project!(Frontend or backend depending on the track). Remember that sometimes there are multiple ways to get to a solution. We encourage you to look things up online or ask questions if you are lost. We will be sharing helpful resources with you throughout this course.
