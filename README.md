# Web3 Workshop

This workshop will be about getting your hands dirty in the web3 space by creating your first NFT project! This project will be initially divided into three tracks - frontend, backend, and stretch challenges.

## How the workshop will work

The workshop is a collection of coding challenges to familiarize you with web3 development in general. It is not a complete tutorial, as that is too much to learn in one day, but it is an excellent primer to grasp the overall concept.

We've designed each coding challenge to be more complicated than the previous one. Remember that sometimes there are multiple ways to get to a solution. We encourage you to look things up online or ask questions if you are lost. We will be sharing helpful resources with you throughout this course.

We'll also host a [#workshop](https://discord.com/channels/935159951423340625/1045998823392153600) channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/xF5dtjZH73), where you can ask questions and get help from the workshop facilitators and other participants. We will also be sharing resources and links there.

You can refer to the accompanying presentation for more information about the workshop in general on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFTCVN0tKk/UwUQ3JJdV6_0scOUtneGTQ/view?utm_content=DAFTCVN0tKk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink).

We have also included a [glossary](./GLOSSARY.md) that includes terms that are often used in the crypto-space, along with their explanations.

## The different tracks

In the backend (or smart contract) track, you will learn how to create an NFT smart contract using a new programming language and development framework. The frontend track builds on your existing knowledge and shows you how to view, interact, and mint NFTs using Next.js (13).

You can refer to the stretch challenges if you're already familiar with web3 development or need a more significant challenge. You may also start with the stretch challenges immediately if you are working in teams. In that case, try the challenges of your respective track before the workshop.

## Getting started

Below you'll find the different tracks, but we recommend that all participants first go through the [Workshop Preparation](PREPARATION.md) guide, which will help you set up your development environment and explain the core concepts of web3.
